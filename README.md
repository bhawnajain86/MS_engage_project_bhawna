# Book Recommendation System Using KNN Algorithm
This project is a simple book recommendation system that is used to recommend a book on the basis of the book entered by user. This recommendation is based on popularity of the book. 
The algorithm used in here is KNN Algorithm.
The data set can be obtained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mohitnirgulkar/book-recommendation-data) collected by [Cai-Nicolas Ziegler](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)


The code uses the following libraries:
- Flask
- gunicorn
- Jinja2
- MarkupSafe
- Werkzeug
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- pandas

## To run this project
1. Download code as zip and data from url[here](https://www.kaggle.com/mohitnirgulkar/book-recommendation-data) collected by [Cai-Nicolas Ziegler](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/)
2. Open command-prompt from that location.
3. Run the app.py file using > python app.py 
4. This will then open a live URL as localhost
5. You can now enter your favourite book name from data set.!!
